# Deep-Learning-Project
# Aerial Perspective Object Detection

## Project Description

The project centers around the Semantic Drone Dataset, focusing on the semantic understanding of urban scenes to enhance the safety of autonomous drone flights and landings. The dataset includes high-resolution images captured from a bird's eye view, depicting over 20 houses and various objects at altitudes of 5 to 30 meters. These images, obtained at 6000x4000px resolution, have been annotated for twenty standard classes, including trees, persons, cars, and pavement.
