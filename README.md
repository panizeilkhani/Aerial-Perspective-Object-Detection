# Aerial Perspective Object Detection

## Project Description

The project centers around the Semantic Drone Dataset, focusing on the semantic understanding of urban scenes to enhance the safety of autonomous drone flights and landings. The dataset includes high-resolution images captured from a bird's eye view, depicting over 20 houses and various objects at altitudes of 5 to 30 meters. These images, obtained at 6000x4000px resolution, have been annotated for twenty standard classes, including trees, persons, cars, and pavement.

## Project Outcomes

This project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

1. **Identify Everyday Objects:** Identify everyday objects such as cars and roads in bird's eye view images.

2. **Large-Scale Object Identification:** Use a trained model to identify objects over a large, continuous, mapped area.

3. **Pedestrian Safety Enhancement:** Use the positioning of cars and people determined to flag areas where pedestrians may be at
most risk of an accident
